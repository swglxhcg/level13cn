# Contributing to Level 13

## General

Level 13 is a personal side project but it has been improved by bug reports, suggestions and fixes from the community. If you are interested in contributing, read the notes below FIRST. Please keep in mind that it might take a while for your submissions to be reviewed.

## Issues

You can use issues to submit bug reports or to suggest new features or enhancements to existing features. At this state of development, bug reports are especially helpful.

* Only submit one bug or feature request per issue
* Before creating a new issue, check that it hasn't already been posted
* For bugs, write down what happened and what you expected to happen
* Mention the version number you were playing (you can find it in the bottom left of the page)

## Pull requests

If you've found a bug and know how to fix it, you can use pull requests to submit small fixes to the code. Just roughly follow the style of the existing code. For the time being please refrain from sending pull requests containing bigger refactoring or new behaviour without getting in touch with me first.

## Other

Feel free to open discussions and edit the wiki - just remember to remain civil.
